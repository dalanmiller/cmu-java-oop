#Repo for Java OOP homework Fall 2013 at CMU

If you are another student and decide that it's a good idea to plagarize my work, you do so at your own risk. I am not liable for anyone using my code for their homework submissions.

You navigating this repository accepts the fact that you are solely responsible should you decide that you are going to use my work as your own for your educational purposes.

Thank you,

Daniel
